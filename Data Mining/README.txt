Data Science Projects
This repository contains a collection of data science and machine learning projects. Each project includes data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation. Below are brief descriptions of each project:

Projects
Comparing Model Performance
Compares the performance of logistic regression, k-NN, decision trees, random forests, and Naive Bayes using various performance metrics.

Diabetes Prediction
Predicts diabetes in patients using logistic regression. Includes data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and model evaluation with confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC curve.

Employee Attrition Prediction
Predicts employee attrition using logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests. Evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC AUC.

Marketing Campaign Response Prediction
Predicts the response to a marketing campaign using logistic regression. Evaluation is done using confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC AUC.

Wine Quality Prediction
Predicts wine quality based on physicochemical properties using k-NN. Evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC.

Real Estate Price Prediction
Predicts real estate prices using multiple linear regression. Evaluation metrics include R-squared, MAE, RMSE, and max error.

Initial Analysis - Air Quality Prediction
Predicts air quality based on pollutant concentrations using logistic regression. Evaluation is done using metrics like confusion matrix and ROC curve.
